## 🥰 Interests

- 💻 **Learning to do things right**: I really enjoy learning new things, putting them into practice and teaching them. I always have more courses and books half-finished than I would like. Some of the books that have made me fall in love with the software world are:
  - Unit Testing Principles, Practices, and Patterns - _Vladimir Khorikov_
  - The Clean Coder - _Robert C. Martin_
  - Head First Design Patterns: Building Extensible and Maintainable Object-Oriented Software - _Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson_
  - User Story Mapping: Discover the Whole Story, Build the Right Product - _Patton, Jeff, Fowler, Martin, Economy, Peter, Cooper, Alan, Cagan, Marty_
  - Implementing Domain-Driven Design - _Vaughn Vernon_
  - Designing Data-Intensive Applications - _Martin Kleppmann_
  - Git for Teams - _Emma Jane Hogbin Westby_

- 📚 **Learning to deal better with the world**: Psychology and philosophy for me are refuges that help me to understand myself in the world and to get enough motivation to try to do things better. Some of the ideas that have been with me for a long time and that I never get tired of exploring are:
  - [Effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/)
  - Veganism
  - Feminism
  - Non-violent communication
  - Rational emotive behavior therapy

- 💃 **Art**: I love to write, dance and from time to time I allow myself to make music (without anyone listening). I also love theater, documentaries, movies and any production that allows me to empathize and shed a tear or two.
